# labs-assembler

A bunch of ansible scripts to combine the various labs repos into one deployable artifact
The frontend is placed into the http/ subdirectory of the API project to be served by a server of your choice.

You can download the generated artifacts from Amazon S3.

Still to do: Handling of config files
